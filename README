About
----------------------------------------

bashmount is a menu-driven bash script that uses udisks to easily mount,
unmount or eject removable devices, without dependencies on any GUI or desktop
environment. An extensive configuration file allows many aspects of the script
to be modified and custom commands to be run on devices.

    == IMPORTANT ======================================================
    |  The configuration file should be edited first before running.  |
    |  Make sure to always check the configuration file provided in   |
    |  each new release, as some options may be changed or added.     |
    ===================================================================

This script does not provide automounting of removable media as there are
already many ways to automount. The file managers in GNOME and KDE handle
automounting, while udev rules or scripts like Udiskie can be used in other
environments. However, bashmount can be used alongside any of these, and
should work in any recent distribution that uses udisks.



Dependencies
----------------------------------------

 * bash
 * dbus
 * udisks

This script should work on all recent distributions that use udisks. Older
distributions may still be using the deprecated HAL, which is not supported
by bashmount.



Installation
----------------------------------------

1. As root, copy "bashmount" to "/usr/bin" or any other location in $PATH:

      install -m755 bashmount /usr/bin/bashmount

2. Backup any existing configuration files.

3. As root, copy "bashmount.conf" to "/etc/bashmount.conf" for global
   configuration:

      install -m644 bashmount.conf /etc/bashmount.conf

4. Optionally, copy "bashmount.conf" to "$HOME/.config/bashmount/config"
   for per-user configuration:

      install -d -m755 $HOME/.config/bashmount/
      install -m644 bashmount.conf $HOME/.config/bashmount/config

5. Ignore this step if you are using a graphical login manager.

   If you do not use a graphical login manager, consult the documentation
   provided by your distribution on how to run a session with consolekit.
   The following instructions may not work in all distributions.

   Place the following in "$HOME/.xinitrc":

        if test -z "${DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS}"; then
            eval "$(dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session)"
        fi
        exec ck-launch-session [window_manager]

6. Make life a bit easier by setting an alias in "$HOME/.bashrc":

        alias bm='bashmount'
