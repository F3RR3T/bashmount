Differences between the rewrite of bashmount and the original version:

1.	Configuration

1.1	Variables

* "optical_devices" and "removable_devices" are no longer present.
* "show_internal" is set to '1' by default.
* "show_removable_device_filename" and "show_optical_device_filename" have been replaced by
  a single variable named "show_device_path".
* "fancy_sort" is no longer present.

1.2	Functions

* "mount_command" and "unmount_command" have been introduced.


2.	Implementation

* Information retrieval is based on "lsblk" instead of "udisks". The use of udisks is optional.
* Information retrieval does not make use of piping into grep.
* "awk" and "sort" are no longer used.
* The disk size in byte is not converted, as the human readable format is printed by lsblk. 
* Mounting devices is done in the function "mount_command", which can be configured by the user.
  Again, the use of udisks for mounting is optional.
* The device blacklist is matched against the output of "lsblk -P", which prints key-value-pairs.
* The number and letter of user input is retrieved without using "printf" or "grep".
* The list of devices is sorted by internal, removable and optical devices.
* The function "fancy_sort" is no longer required, as lsblk sorts the devices accordingly.


3.	User interface

* Devices are sorted by internal media, removable media and optical media.
* Hitting enter is not a valid command.
* Only partitions are listed, no disks.
* Opened luks containers are also listed.
