bashmount - tool to mount and unmount removable media

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<bashmount>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

bashmount is a menu-driven bash script that can use different
backends to easily mount, unmount or eject removable devices
without dependencies on udisks or any GUI. An extensive
configuration file allows many aspects of the script to be
modified and custom commands to be run on devices.
bashmount can also be used alongside any automounting solutions,
such as graphical file managers, udev rules or Udiskie.
