Dependencies
============

 * bash
 * dbus
 * udisks

bashmount should work on all recent distributions that use udisks. Older
distributions may still be using the deprecated HAL, which is not supported
by bashmount.



Installation
============

1. As root, copy "bashmount" to "/usr/bin" or any other location in $PATH:

        install -m755 bashmount /usr/bin/bashmount

2. Backup any existing configuration files.

3. As root, copy "bashmount.conf" to "/etc/bashmount.conf" for global
   configuration:

        install -m644 bashmount.conf /etc/bashmount.conf

4. Optionally, copy "bashmount.conf" to "$HOME/.config/bashmount/config"
   for per-user configuration:

        mkdir -p $HOME/.config/bashmount/
        install -m644 bashmount.conf $HOME/.config/bashmount/config

5. Optionally, copy "bashmount.1.gz" to "/usr/share/man/man1":

        install -m644 bashmount.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/bashmount.1.gz

6. Ignore this step if you are using a graphical login manager.

   If you do not use a graphical login manager, consult the documentation
   provided by your distribution on how to run a session with consolekit.
   The following instructions may not work in all distributions.

   Place the following in "$HOME/.xinitrc":

        if test -z "${DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS}"; then
            eval "$(dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session)"
        fi
        exec ck-launch-session [window_manager]

7. Make life a bit easier by setting an alias in "$HOME/.bashrc":

        alias bm='bashmount'
